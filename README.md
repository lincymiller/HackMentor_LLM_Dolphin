                                                        Overview
                                                 
The HackMentor LLM with Dolphin Llama3 is a specialized language model designed to assist in cybersecurity tasks. With its fine-tuned capabilities, it can identify zero-day vulnerabilities, perform penetration testing, and analyze source code for security issues.

                                                        Installation
                                                        
                                                        Prerequisites
                                                        
                                           Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
transformers library
bitsandbytes for efficient 8-bit model loading (optional for memory optimization)
accelerate for handling large models
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/lincymiller/HackMentor_LLM_Dolphin.git
cd HackMentor_LLM_Dolphin
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If there is no requirements.txt file, you can manually install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers bitsandbytes accelerate
Usage
Loading the Model
The following is an example of how to load the model and tokenizer:

python
Copy code
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Set the path to the directory containing your model files
base_model_path = 'path/to/your_model_directory'  # Update this path accordingly

print("Loading tokenizer...")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_path, local_files_only=True)
print("Tokenizer loaded successfully.")

print("Loading model...")
try:
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        base_model_path,
        load_in_8bit=True,  # Optional: Use 8-bit precision for memory efficiency
        device_map="auto",  # Automatically distribute across available devices
        local_files_only=True
    )
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while loading the model: {e}")

# Example interaction loop
while True:
    input_text = input("You: ")
    inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=100)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"HackMentor: {response}")

    
                                              Running the Model
                                              
Ensure your model files (e.g., config.json, tokenizer.json, .safetensors files) are located in the specified directory.
Adjust the base_model_path as needed.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
Required libraries: transformers, bitsandbytes, accelerate
Model Files
The following files should be included in your model directory:

config.json
tokenizer.json
.safetensors files (model-00001-of-00004.safetensors, etc.) Make sure all necessary files are present for successful model loading and execution.
